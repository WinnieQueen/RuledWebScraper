# RuledWebScraper
This project (made with Blazor WebAssembly and xUnit tests) is a website/html scraper in which the user can give 'rules' that all attributes must follow (ie, all attributes must have unique ids, or a class). 
This is also meant to give me an opportunity to try out test-driven development.
